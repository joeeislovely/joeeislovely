### Hello, this is Sang 👋🏻.

I am a Junior at [Bradley University](https://www.bradley.edu). Currently, I am a Computer Science and Statistics major. 

I am from Hanoi, Vietnam. Without coding and homework, I usually play [Teamfight Tactics](https://lolchess.gg/profile/na/girlsace) and FIFA 22. I also work as a part-time Supervisor at Bradley’s Renaissance Coliseum. I enjoy great food and interesting conversations, and I am also a big Chelsea fan.

I am best reached via [email](mailto:nguyenminh.sangatpa@gmail.com) and [Messenger](https://m.me/joeeislovely). Feel free to shoot me a message for any interesting ideas.
